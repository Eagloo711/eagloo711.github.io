      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        As a Law and Computer Science student, I am fascinated by the
        intersection of legal and technological issues,and how they affect
        society and individuals. I am currently in my first year of studies, and
        I aim to graduate in May2026 with a solid foundation in both fields,
        with a vast amount of experience under my belt. I am currently workingon
        many projects. In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I
        am deeply involved in various charitable and volunteer organizations
        that reflect my commitment to societal betterment. As the treasurer of
        Rêvons Réalisons, I manage financial operations with transparency and
        efficiency, ensuring that resources are allocated to maximize impact.
        Ialso support less fortunate families through the Association de la
        Fondation Étudiante pour la Ville (AFEV), where I dedicate my time and
        empathy to their needs and aspirations. I am eager to apply my knowledge
        and skills to new challenges and opportunities, and to collaborate with
        diverseand innovative teams. I believe that I can bring a unique
        perspective and experience to the field that interest me,and to the
        organization that I work with. I also have a keen interest in
        philosophy, which I pursue independently. This intellectual pursuit
        complements myformal studies, allowing me to explore deeper ethical,
        metaphysical, and epistemological questions that intersect(or not) with
        both law and computer science. I'm a multipotentialite, my life
        philosophy can be summed up with one sentence: "All I know is that I
        know nothing."

        <h3>Volunteer Mentor, AFEV</h3>
        <p>
          Sep 2023 - Present (7 months) Volunteering with the AFEV has been a
          transformative journey thus far, where I've had the opportunity to
          mentor a child from a less fortunate background. Upon arriving in
          France, I was firmly resolved that my stay should extend beyond
          personal pursuits of education and work and should meaningfully
          contribute to the betterment of the community. This ethos guided me to
          the AFEV, where I dedicate myself to providing a young individual with
          the tools necessary for academic success and personal development. Our
          interactions go beyond academic tutoring; they encompass fostering
          resilience, encouraging a mindset geared towards success, and guiding
          him to transcend his immediate circumstances. This experience has
          profoundly underscored the importance of empathy and commitment in
          making a tangible difference, reaffirming my commitment to leaving a
          positive imprint on the community that has welcomed me. More than
          anything, this journey has illuminated the depths of our individual
          privileges and the extraordinary capacity we have to extend them in
          service to others.

          oversee and manage the financial aspects of our initiatives but also
          gives me the opportunity to contribute hands-on in our mission to

          to blend strategic financial oversight with compassionate community
          engagement, driving forward our vision that I like to think is shared

          Aug 2021 - Sep 2023 (2 years 2 months) Leveraging extensive experience

          leadership, strategic thinking, and effective communication to every

          analyze game mechanics deeply, develop tailored coaching strategies,
          and foster a collaborative environment that empowers individuals and
          teams to achieve their full potential. I was committed to not only
          elevating gameplay but also to instilling the critical soft skills of
          teamwork, adaptability, and resilience, which transcend the virtual
          battlefield and are applicable in various professional contexts. My

          team is a foundation of trust, clear communication, and a shared

          every coaching session before even discussing the game itself.

          Technologies, where I gained valuable insights into Cybersecurity and
          Cloud Computing, two of the most relevant and dynamic domains in the
          tech industry. I worked with a team of experts to learn about
          encryption, authentication, network security, cloud architecture, and
          data management, and how they are applied to protect and optimize data
          on a large scale. I also developed my skills in project management,

          Jul 2021 - Jun 2022 (1 year) During my apprenticeship with Jafep, a
          dynamic company at the forefront of its industry, I was afforded a
          valuable glimpse into the intricacies of the business world. This
          experience exposed me to the art of negotiation and the essentials of
          successful business management, providing me with a practical
          understanding of what drives a company's success. I observed firsthand
          how effective communication and strategic decision-making facilitate
          the forging of beneficial partnerships and the achievement of business
          objectives. I also had the opportunity to enhance my technical skills,

          visuals, I contributed to the aesthetic appeal and marketing
          effectiveness of the items featured on Jafep's website. This
